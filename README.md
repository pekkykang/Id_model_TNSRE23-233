Please dowload the data from original author.

training_xxx: train the cycleGAN or baseline id models.

model_xxx: the model structure of one type of baseline models.

We can only provide a demo model structure for baseline models.

Please dowload the baseline models from original author.

We reused lots of code from https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/tree/master
